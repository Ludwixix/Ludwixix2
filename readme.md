**My General Idea**

The website was planned after selecting images I found interesting. I then made a few mockups on figma using different color pallets and designs. I finally settled upon my current design with a few changes.

DNS - Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Internet's equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

Web Browser - Browsers translate web pages and websites delivered using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) into human-readable content. They also have the ability to display other protocols and prefixes, such as secure HTTP (HTTPS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), email handling (mailto:), and files (file:). In addition, most browsers also support external plug-ins required to display active content, such as in-page video, audio and game content.

The internet has made it possible for anyone, anywhere in the world to communicate in real-time via video or audio. It's MAGIC!
